We have created a web app and Chrome extension that allows first responders and veterans to contribute useful mental health resources to a community curated page with the clicks of a few buttons. The extension also automatically flags any Google search results that have been recommended to our app and users can browse, filter, and upvote resources with our app's clean interface.
